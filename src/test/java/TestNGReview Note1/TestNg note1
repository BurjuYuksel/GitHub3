4-What is maven?
5-Maven is a build automation tool that help us manage dependencies,
6-create project structure/hierarchy
7-and execute our test cases
8-Maven can be used primary  with java applications,but  can also work in other languages
9-
10-How does maven manages the dependencies?
11-Maven has a central repository where we have all the jar files instead of adding them manually we can simply add them
in our
12-POM.xml file and maven takes care of it automatically

what is TestNg?
Testing automation Framework

annotations:
1-@Test ==> marks the method as test method
2-@Before ==> preconditions(suite,test,method,class)
 3-@After Method-it executes after every test as a post condition

@BeforeClass-it executes once before the class executes
@AfterClass-it executes after the class executes

Testng attributes-
priority -by default priority is set to 0
enabled- by default every Tc true ,if we need to exclude TC WE HAVE TO SET THIS TO FALSE

Assertion is of 2 types-
Hard Assertion- the moment it finds an error, it stops execution and gives us the break point .

what is our xml file?
Configuration file for testNG

<suite>
<test>
      <classes>
       <class name=" ">
           < methods>
             </methods>
        </classes>
              </test>

        <test>
           <classes>
       </classes>
</test>
   </suite>

DataDriben testing:
it is just a concept in which we
test the same functionality against different set of Data

to write the code is a manner that if data cahnges it does not effect the source code

@DtaProvider in testNg to implement dot
two steps:
1.we have a method that returns an object of 2D array
2. call dataProvider method to te st  what ever we need

Assertions in TestNG:

1-Hard Assertions==>Assert class==> stops the execution once it
2.soft assertion==>
